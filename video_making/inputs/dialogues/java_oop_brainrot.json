      "character": "character1",
      "text": "Nah fam, Encapsulation is like keeping your variables on private mode! You hide the data and only let methods access it. It's giving main character energy for data protection!"

      "text": "That's actually lowkey genius! So it's like having a security system for your code? What about this inheritance thing that sounds sus?"
